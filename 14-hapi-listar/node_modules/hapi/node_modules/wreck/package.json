Note that this is limited to the initial request only.\nIf the request was already redirected, aborting the original request will not abort execution of pending redirections.\n\n\n### `defaults(options)`\n\nReturns a *new* instance of Wreck which merges the provided `options` with those provided on a per-request basis. You can call defaults repeatedly to build up multiple http clients.\n- `options` - Config object containing settings for both `request` and `read` operations.\n\n### `request(method, uri, [options])`\n\nInitiate an HTTP request.\n- `method` - A string specifying the HTTP request method, defaulting to 'GET'.\n- `uri` - The URI of the requested resource.\n- `options` - An optional configuration object. To omit this argument but still\n  use a callback, pass `null` in this position. The options object supports the\n  following optional keys:\n    - `baseUrl` - fully qualified uri string used as the base url. Most useful with `request.defaults`, for example when you want to do many requests to the same domain.\n                  If `baseUrl` is `https://example.com/api/`, then requesting `/end/point?test=true` will fetch `https://example.com/api/end/point?test=true`. Any\n                  querystring in the `baseUrl` will be overwritten with the querystring in the `uri` When `baseUrl` is given, `uri` must also be a string.\n    - `socketPath` - `/path/to/unix/socket` for Server.\n    - `payload` - The request body as a string, Buffer, Readable Stream, or an object that can be serialized using `JSON.stringify()`.\n    - `headers` - An object containing request headers.\n    - `redirects` - The maximum number of redirects to follow.\n    - `redirect303` - if `true`, a HTTP 303 status code will redirect using a GET method. Defaults to no redirection on 303.\n    - `beforeRedirect` - A callback function that is called before a redirect is triggered, using the signature\n      `function(redirectMethod, statusCode, location, resHeaders, redirectOptions, next)` where:\n          - `redirectMethod` - A string specifying the redirect method.\n          - `statusCode` - HTTP status code of the response that triggered the redirect.\n          - `location` - The redirect location string.\n          - `resHeaders` - An object with the headers received as part of the redirection response.\n          - `redirectOptions` - Options that will be applied to the redirect request. Changes to this object are applied to the redirection request.\n          - `next` - the callback function called to perform the redirection using signature `function()`.\n    - `redirected` - A callback function that is called when a redirect was triggered, using the signature `function(statusCode, location, req)` where:\n      - `statusCode` - HTTP status code of the response that triggered the redirect.\n      - `location` - The redirected location string.\n      - `req` - The new [ClientRequest](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest) object which replaces the one initially returned.\n    - `timeout` - The number of milliseconds to wait without receiving a response\n      before aborting the request. Defaults to unlimited.\n    - `maxBytes` - maximum size for response payload. Defaults to unlimited.\n    - `rejectUnauthorized` - [TLS](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html) flag indicating\n      whether the client should reject a response from a server with invalid certificates.  This cannot be set at the\n      same time as the `agent` option is set.\n    - `downstreamRes`: downstream Resource dependency.\n    - `agent` - Node Core [http.Agent](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent).\n      Defaults to either `wreck.agents.http` or `wreck.agents.https`.  Setting to `false` disables agent pooling.\n    - `secureProtocol` - [TLS](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html) flag indicating the SSL method to use, e.g. `SSLv3_method`\n      to force SSL version 3. The possible values depend on your installation of OpenSSL. Read the official OpenSSL docs\n      for possible [SSL_METHODS](http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/ssl.html#DEALING_WITH_PROTOCOL_METHODS).\n    - `ciphers` - [TLS](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_modifying_the_default_tls_cipher_suite) list of TLS ciphers to override node's default.\n      The possible values depend on your installation of OpenSSL. Read the official OpenSSL docs\n      for possible [TLS_CIPHERS](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/apps/ciphers.html#CIPHER-LIST-FORMAT).\n\nReturns a promise that resolves into a node response object. The promise has a `req` property which is the instance of the node.js\n[ClientRequest](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest) object.\n\n### `read(response, options)`\n- `response` - An HTTP Incoming Message object.\n- `options` - `null` or a configuration object with the following optional keys:\n    - `timeout` - The number of milliseconds to wait while reading data before\n    aborting handling of the response. Defaults to unlimited.\n    - `json` - A value indicating how to try to parse the payload as JSON. Defaults to `undefined` meaning no parse logic.\n        - `true`, 'smart' - only try `JSON.parse` if the response indicates a JSON content-type.\n        - `strict` - as 'smart', except returns an error for non-JSON content-type.\n        - `force` - try `JSON.parse` regardless of the content-type header.\n    - `gunzip` - A value indicating the behavior to adopt when the payload is gzipped. Defaults to `undefined` meaning no gunzipping.\n        - `true` - only try to gunzip if the response indicates a gzip content-encoding.\n        - `false` - explicitly disable gunzipping.\n        - `force` - try to gunzip regardless of the content-encoding header.\n    - `maxBytes` - The maximum allowed response payload size. Defaults to unlimited.\n\nReturns a promise that resolves into the payload in the form of a Buffer or (optionally) parsed JavaScript object (JSON).\n\n#### Notes about gunzip\n\nWhen using gunzip, HTTP headers `Content-Encoding`, `Content-Length`, `Content-Range` and `ETag` won't reflect the reality as the payload has been uncompressed.\n\n### `get(uri, [options])`\n\nConvenience method for GET operations.\n- `uri` - The URI of the requested resource.\n- `options` - Optional config object containing settings for both `request` and\n  `read` operations.\n\nReturns a promise that resolves into an object with the following properties:\n    - `res` - The [HTTP Incoming Message](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage)\n       object, which is a readable stream that has \"ended\" and contains no more data to read.\n    - `payload` - The payload in the form of a Buffer or (optionally) parsed JavaScript object (JSON).\n\nThrows any error that may have occurred during handling of the request or a Boom error object if the response has an error status\ncode (i.e. 4xx or 5xx). If the error is a boom error object it will have the following properties in addition to the standard boom\nproperties:\n    - `data.isResponseError` - boolean, indicates if the error is a result of an error response status code\n    - `data.headers` - object containing the response headers\n    - `data.payload` - the payload in the form of a Buffer or as a parsed object\n    - `data.res` - the [HTTP Incoming Message](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object\n\n### `post(uri, [options])`\n\nConvenience method for POST operations.\n- `uri` - The URI of the requested resource.\n- `options` - Optional config object containing settings for both `request` and\n  `read` operations.\n\nReturns a promise that resolves into an object with the following properties:\n    - `res` - The [HTTP Incoming Message](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage)\n       object, which is a readable stream that has \"ended\" and contains no more data to read.\n    - `payload` - The payload in the form of a Buffer or (optionally) parsed JavaScript object (JSON).\n\nThrows any error that may have occurred during handling of the request or a Boom error object if the response has an error status\ncode (i.e. 4xx or 5xx).

If the error is a boom error object it will have the following properties in addition to the standard boom\nproperties:\n    - `data.isResponseError` - boolean, indicates if the error is a result of an error response status code\n    - `data.headers` - object containing the response headers\n    - `data.payload` - the payload in the form of a Buffer or as a parsed object\n    - `data.res` - the [HTTP Incoming Message](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object\n\n### `delete(uri, [options])`\n\nConvenience method for DELETE operations.\n- `uri` - The URI of the requested resource.\n- `options` - Optional config object containing settings for both `request` and\n  `read` operations.\n\nReturns a promise that resolves into an object with the following properties:\n    - `res` - The [HTTP Incoming Message](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage)\n       object, which is a readable stream that has \"ended\" and contains no more data to read.\n    - `payload` - The payload in the form of a Buffer or (optionally) parsed JavaScript object (JSON).\n\nThrows any error that may have occurred during handling of the request or a Boom error object if the response has an error status\ncode (i.e. 4xx or 5xx). If the error is a boom error object it will have the following properties in addition to the standard boom\nproperties:\n    - `data.isResponseError` - boolean, indicates if the error is a result of an error response status code\n    - `data.headers` - object containing the response headers\n    - `data.payload` - the payload in the form of a Buffer or as a parsed object\n    - `data.res` - the [HTTP Incoming Message](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object\n\n### `toReadableStream(payload, [encoding])`\n\nCreates a [readable stream](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable)\nfor the provided payload and encoding.\n- `payload` - The Buffer or string to be wrapped in a readable stream.\n- `encoding` - The encoding to use. Must be a valid Buffer encoding, such as 'utf8' or 'ascii'.\n\n<!-- eslint-disable no-unused-vars -->\n<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->\n```javascript\nconst stream = Wreck.toReadableStream(Buffer.from('Hello', 'ascii'), 'ascii');\nconst read = stream.read();\n// read -> 'Hello'\n```\n\n### `parseCacheControl(field)`\n\nParses the provided *cache-control* request header value into an object containing\na property for each directive and it's value. Boolean directives, such as \"private\"\nor \"no-cache\" will be set to the boolean `true`.\n- `field` - The header cache control value to be parsed.\n\n<!-- eslint-disable no-unused-vars -->\n<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->\n```javascript\nconst result = Wreck.parseCacheControl('private, max-age=0, no-cache');\n// result.private -> true\n// result['max-age'] -> 0\n// result['no-cache'] -> true\n```\n\n### `agents`\n\nObject that contains the agents for pooling connections for `http` and `https`.\nThe properties are `http`, `https`, and `httpsAllowUnauthorized` which is an\n`https` agent with `rejectUnauthorized` set to false.  All agents have\n`maxSockets` configured to `Infinity`.  They are each instances of the Node.js\n[Agent](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent) and expose the\nstandard properties.\n\nFor example, the following code demonstrates changing `maxSockets` on the `http`\nagent.\n\n ```js\n const Wreck = require('wreck');\n\n Wreck.agents.http.maxSockets = 20;\n ```\n\nBelow is another example that sets the certificate details for all HTTPS requests.\n\n<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->\n```js\nconst HTTPS = require('https');\nconst Wreck = require('wreck');\n\nWreck.agents.https = new HTTPS.Agent({\n    cert,\n    key,\n    ca\n});\n```\n\n### Events\n\nTo enable events, use `Wreck.defaults({ events: true })`. Events are available via the\n`events` emitter attached to the client returned by `Wreck.defaults()`.\n\n#### `request`\n\nThe request event is emitted just before *wreck* makes a request.  The\nhandler should accept the following arguments `(uri, options)` where:\n\n  - `uri` - the result of `Url.parse(uri)`. This will provide information about\n  the resource requested.  Also includes the headers and method.\n  - `options` - the options passed into the request function.  This will include\n  a payload if there is one.\n\nSince the `request` event executes on a global event handler, you can intercept\nand decorate a request before its sent.\n\n\n#### `response`\n\nThe response event is always emitted for any request that *wreck* makes.  The\nhandler should accept the following arguments `(err, details)` where:\n\n  - `err` - a Boom error\n  - `details` - object with the following properties\n    - `req` - the raw `ClientHttp` request object\n    - `res` - the raw `IncomingMessage` response object\n    - `start` - the time that the request was initiated\n    - `uri` - the result of `Url.parse(uri)`. This will provide information about\n    the resource requested.  Also includes the headers and method.\n\nThis event is useful for logging all requests that go through *wreck*. The `err`\nand `res` arguments can be undefined depending on if an error occurs.  Please\nbe aware that if multiple modules are depending on the same cached *wreck*\nmodule that this event can fire for each request made across all modules.  The\n`start` property is the timestamp when the request was started.  This can be\nuseful for determining how long it takes *wreck* to get a response back and\nprocessed.\n",
